===============================================

* Write a program that will take the given String and return a version that is all lowercase except for the middle character/s. 
	If the word is even length, both middle characters should be captital
	If the word is odd length, there will only be one middle character 

	Ex: apple -> apPle


* Write a program that will have a String date, which will have format: mm/dd/yyyy. Take the input date and print out the Month name instead of number and the day
	Ex: 
		Input: 08/10/2020
		Output: October 10


* Write a program that will accept a String and check if the a's and b's in the String are balanced. A String is balanced whenever there is an 'a' character and somewhere later in the String there is a 'b' character
	Ex:
		Input: "abcab"
		Output: "balanced"

		Input: "bacdf"
		Output: "not balanced"

		Input: "ayeba"
		Output: "not balanced"


* Write a program that will take two String and combine them
	Ex:
		Input: "java", "apple"
		Output: "jaapvpale"


* Write a program that can return the frequency of the word from a sentence 
	Ex: 
		Input: "java, javascript and css java and datebase, java
				"java"
		Output: 4


* Write a program that can return the frequency of each letter in the given String
	Ex:
		Input: "ABBBCCDEE"
		Output: 
			A: 1
			B: 3
			C: 2
			D: 1
			E: 2


* Create a method that accepts a String and determines if the given String is palindrome (return boolean)

	-> Palindrome is going to be a String that read the same way fowards and backwards

		Before we reverse the String and check if its equal 


			r a c e c a r

			r == r
			a == a
			c == c


* Create a method that will accept two Strings and determine if they are Anagrams of each other (return boolean)

	->  listen 
		silent 

approach: 	
		l i s t e r 
		n
